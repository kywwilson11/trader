"""Single source of truth for strategy/policy parameters.

The trading loops AND the backtester read these — if they drift apart, the
backtest validates a different policy than the one trading. Keep every
tunable that affects entries/exits/sizing here.

Stop-distance floors: the old 5%/6% floors swallowed the ATR logic for
most names (raw 2-2.5x hourly ATR is ~0.6-3%), making stops effectively
fixed-percent and pushing the 3:1-RR take-profit to an unreachable 15-30%.
Floors now only guard against degenerate sub-spread stops; ATR does the
work. TP ratio lowered to 2:1 accordingly.
